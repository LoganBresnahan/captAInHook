# Flow: hook dispatch — from agent event to merged effect

How one lifecycle event travels through the C# core: in on stdin (parsed per
the selected harness spec), fanned out to supervised handler workers under a
budget, merged deterministically, capability-gated, out on stdout in the
harness's wire format — with a structured JSONL trail the whole way.

## The I/O contract

Hook mode's **stdout is the protocol channel**: the agent host parses it as
the hook's response, so exactly one JSON object may ever appear there. All
diagnostics are split by audience — humans get the `Trace` summary and pretty
one-liners on stderr; machines get JSONL in the log file. This is why
`Logging.fs` structurally cannot write to stdout.

## The shim's warm path (ADR-0004, in progress)

In shim mode (`hook <event>` without `--no-daemon`) the binary first tries the
content-identity socket (`Core/ShimClient.cs`): connect + forward the framed
request (the shim-minted dispatchId, event, harness, raw stdin bytes
verbatim), relay the framed response (stdout bytes byte-identically, trace to
stderr, exit code). Deadlines are phase-scoped: pre-delivery (connect + write,
250ms) — expiry proves non-delivery and permits the collapsed fallback the
diagram above shows — versus response (5s, covering the daemon's dispatch
budget + grace) — expiry is a FAILED dispatch (zero stdout bytes, exit 1),
never a retry, because the daemon may already be running non-idempotent
Background effects. The at-most-once boundary is the request frame's write
completion, encoded in `ForwardOutcome`: only `NotDelivered` falls back —
and the boundary is EXACT: `Frame.WriteAsync`'s `committed` marker fires the
instant the last payload byte is accepted by the transport, so a deadline
landing on the flush or on the way out of the write classifies
after-delivery (no fallback) instead of double-running the hook. A
collapsed fallback reuses the shim's dispatchId — one id, one story in the
trail — and fires `DaemonSpawner.SpawnDaemonForNextHook`: the engine spawned
as `--daemon`, fully detached (/dev/null stdio — the host waits for the
shim's stdout EOF, so an inherited fd would hang it; cwd at /; reparented to
init via an intermediate /bin/sh; environment inherited, so `CAPTAINHOOK_*`
becomes daemon-start config). This hook collapses; the next rides the warm
path. Daemon-side (`Core/DaemonHost.cs`): acquire the lock or exit 0, warm up
— registry, dispatcher, supervised workers, harness specs, all built ONCE —
then bind (listening ⟺ ready) and serve one dispatch per connection on the
shared dispatcher, adopting the shim's dispatchId. Harness specs keep
ADR-0003's edit-a-spec-effective-next-hook contract via a per-file composite
stamp of the override dir each dispatch (`ReloadingHarnessRegistry` — per-file
because in-place overwrites never bump the dir's mtime); the rest of
`CAPTAINHOOK_*` is daemon-start configuration, and the stderr pretty sink
defaults off in daemon mode (the JSONL file is the record). On SIGTERM/SIGINT
the daemon DRAINS (decision 4): listener closes first (mid-drain hooks get
refused → collapse, never hang), in-flight dispatches still get their
responses, queued/running Background effects complete — both phases under
one deadline (default 10s; a blown deadline exits anyway and logs
`daemon.drainTimeout` with the dropped counts) — then socket and pidfile are
unlinked and it exits 0. Idle-exit is the remaining lifecycle slice; a hard
kill stays safe regardless (the kernel releases the lock, the next winner
unlinks the stale socket).

## The harness boundary

Which host we speak to is data, not code
([ADR-0003](../adr/0003-declarative-harness-registry.md)). `--harness <name>`
(default `claude-code`) selects a `HarnessSpec` from the `HarnessRegistry`:
embedded defaults (`harnesses/*.json`, compiled into the assembly) overlaid
by user overrides from `CAPTAINHOOK_HARNESS_DIR` (else
`~/.captainHook/harnesses`) — a valid same-name file replaces the default
wholesale, a new name adds a harness, and an invalid file is skipped with a
`harness.specInvalid` warning, so a bad override can never crash the live
hook. An unknown `--harness` name exits 1 with a stderr message and **zero**
stdout bytes.

The spec drives both ends of the dispatch. At ingress, `Harness.ParseEvent`
reads the event name, session id, and cwd from whichever payload fields the
spec declares (the CLI event arg wins over the payload field). At egress, the
merged effect passes `Harness.ApplyCapabilityGate`: an effect kind the spec
never declared for that event is downgraded to `Noop` with a
`harness.effectUnsupported` warning — never send a harness something it
cannot represent — while an event *absent* from the spec passes permissively
with a `harness.eventUndeclared` debug line. The surviving effect is then
serialized by the adapter the spec names (`claude-hook-json` or
`generic-json`) — a CLOSED, coded set: data selects *which* adapter, code
defines *what* it emits, and config never becomes a template language.

## Fan-out under a budget

Handlers run concurrently via `Task.WhenAll` on the thread pool, so dispatch
wall-time tracks the *slowest* handler, not the sum. Each `RunGuarded` is a
**classified ask against the handler's supervised worker** (ADR-0004
decision 5): the dispatch-wide `CancellationTokenSource(budget)` cancels
`ctx.Ct` at the budget, while the ask itself waits **budget + grace** (default
10% of budget, clamped 100ms–1s) so a token-honoring handler's cancellation
reply — which leaves the handler *at* the budget — lands inside the window
instead of racing it. No-answer outcomes are then unambiguous and classified:
`cancelled` (the handler honored its token — a timeout, never a fault),
`wedged` (received but silent — the supervisor abandons the worker and it
counts toward escalation), `backlogged` (never received, queued behind a busy
sibling — uncounted), and `dead` (already-escalated worker — fails fast in
~0ms instead of burning the budget). All four degrade to the handler's
fail-mode effect; classification changes what the *supervisor counts*, never
what the dispatch returns. Worst-case dispatch wall time is budget + grace,
paid only when a handler never answers.

## Handlers as supervised workers

The `Dispatcher` constructor snapshots `Registry.Specs` and spawns **one
generic `Worker<(HookEvent, HandlerContext), Effect>` per registration**
(id `{event}/{name}`) under a one_for_one supervisor — so register all
handlers *before* constructing the Dispatcher; later `On` calls are not picked
up. The registry stores child specs (name, fail mode, factory): the factory
overload of `On` yields a genuinely fresh handler on every supervised restart,
while the instance overload wraps the same object — no state reset, by
documented contract.

A handler exception inside the worker is **reply-then-crash**: the reply
carries the exception back, so `RunGuarded` sees exactly what direct
invocation used to throw — immediately, not after an ask timeout — and
converts it per fail mode; the raise still escapes the loop, so the supervisor
classifies the exit (ADR-0004 decision 5): a crash counts toward the restart
window, an `OperationCanceledException` — the handler *honored* `ctx.Ct` —
restarts the worker **without counting** (`actor.restart` with
`kind=cancelled, counted=false`), so a correct-but-slow handler is never
escalated; its slowness stays visible through `handler.timeout` warns. A
crash-looping or chronically wedging handler blows the restart window and
escalates (`actor.escalate`): the worker is marked dead and every later ask
**fails fast** (`handler.dead`, ~0ms) instead of burning the budget.
Supervision mechanics: [actor-supervision.md](actor-supervision.md);
decisions: [ADR-0002](../adr/0002-handlers-as-supervised-actors.md),
[ADR-0004](../adr/0004-daemon-topology.md) decision 5.

## Failure policy

Each handler declares `IHandler.OnFailure`. On timeout or exception,
`Fail(h)` converts the failure into an effect instead of an exception:
**fail-open** → `Noop` (degrade quietly — right for retrieval/enrichment),
**fail-closed** → `Decide(Deny)` (refuse loudly — right for authz/policy
gates). A failing handler never poisons its siblings' effects.

## Merge precedence

| precedence | effect | rule | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Decide(deny)` | first deny wins outright | a safety veto must be unoverridable |
| 2 | `Decide(ask)` | next | escalate to a human beats content edits |
| 3 | `Replace` | **last registered wins** | replacements don't compose; deliberate, pinned by test |
| 4 | `Inject` | **all concatenate, registration order** | context contributions do compose |
| 5 | `Noop` | only when nothing else | — |

## Background effects

`Effect.Background` work (audit writes, notifications) is routed onto the
dispatcher's LONG-LIVED side channel — it contributes nothing to the merged
effect and the response never waits on it. One consumer task runs the queue;
`BackgroundPending` is the bookkeeping the drain and idle-exit slices share
(a non-empty queue defers exit). Collapsed mode calls
`CompleteBackgroundAsync()` before emitting, so a per-invocation process
still never exits with effects queued — the drain-before-exit contract,
relocated.
