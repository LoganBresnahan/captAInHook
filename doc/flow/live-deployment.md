# Flow: live deployment — a real prompt through the deployed daemon

What exists on this machine when captAInHook is dogfooding: where the
deployed binary lives, how a real Claude Code prompt travels through it, what
the daemon lifecycle looks like operationally, and what a redeploy must do.
The `/deploy` skill *performs* this; this doc explains what it leaves behind.

## The deployed tree

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `~/.captainHook/bin/` | the published build — native `captainShim` (the hook command) + apphost `captainHook` (daemon/collapsed engine) + dlls; the managed dlls' content identity names the socket (the native shim carries no MVID and is invisible to the hash — by design, ADR-0004 d7 amendment) |
| `~/.captainHook/bin.prev/` | the previous build, kept by `/deploy` for one-step rollback |
| `~/.captainHook/logs/captainHook.jsonl` | the trail — shim AND daemon write here (same default), one dispatchId per prompt across both halves |
| `~/.captainHook/harnesses/` | user harness overrides — editable live; the daemon stats the dir per dispatch and reloads (`harness.reload`) |
| `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/captainHook/captaind-<ver>.{sock,lock,pid}` | rendezvous files, 0600; `<ver>` = content identity of the deployed bin dir |

## Operations

- **Is a daemon running?** Read `captaind-<ver>.pid` (pid, binary path,
  started-at), then check `/proc/<pid>/exe` still points at a captainHook
  binary — pids get reused; never trust the pid alone.
- **Kill it** — `kill <pid>` (SIGTERM) now drains gracefully: in-flight
  prompts get their responses, queued Background work completes (10s
  deadline), socket and pidfile are removed on the way out
  (`daemon.drainStart` → `daemon.drained` in the trail). `kill -9` remains
  safe too — the kernel releases the lock, the next prompt collapses and
  respawns. Never delete `.lock` files.
- **Sweep leftovers**: `~/.captainHook/bin/captainHook doctor` — dead
  pidfiles/sockets removed, pid-reused records cleaned without signaling the
  stranger, superseded daemons (their binary's path computes a different
  identity now) SIGTERM-drained then SIGKILLed after grace, healthy daemons
  and lock files untouched. Runnable from any build: lineage is judged
  per-path, so a dev-tree doctor never kills a healthy deployed daemon.
- **Watch it live**: `tail -f ~/.captainHook/logs/captainHook.jsonl` — a warm
  event is `shim.answered` + daemon-side `dispatch.start/done` under one
  dispatchId; a cold one is `shim.fallback` + `shim.spawnDaemon` +
  `shim.delegated` wrapping the engine's collapsed `dispatch.*`; a partial
  deploy is `shim.wireSkew` + `shim.delegated` (hook still answers).
- **Worst cases, by design**: daemon wedged → the shim's 5s response deadline
  fires once (`shim.deliveryFailed`, exit 1, zero stdout — the prompt
  proceeds without the hook's effect), and the wedged daemon must be killed
  manually until doctor lands. Daemon dead → every prompt collapses (~200ms,
  today's pre-daemon cost) and respawns; nothing breaks.

## Redeploy = new identity

Publishing changed bytes to `~/.captainHook/bin` changes the content
identity, so the next prompt rendezvouses on a **fresh socket by
construction** — the old daemon can never serve stale code. The superseded
daemon starves and idle-exits within its window on its own; `/deploy` runs
`doctor` to retire it immediately rather than waiting. A no-op republish
(deterministic compilation, unchanged source) keeps the identity and the
warm daemon.

## Rollback

Swap the previous build back (`mv ~/.captainHook/bin ~/.captainHook/bin.bad
&& mv ~/.captainHook/bin.prev ~/.captainHook/bin`) — the hook command path is
unchanged, the restored dlls compute the old identity, and the next event
rendezvouses accordingly. Pointing the settings.json command at the engine
(`…/bin/captainHook hook <event>`) also remains valid — the engine keeps its
full shim mode for exactly this.

| deploy procedure (the executable version of this doc) | `.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` |
