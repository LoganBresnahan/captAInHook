# Flow: actor supervision — crash to restart (or escalation)

How the F# actor layer keeps state-holding workers alive: spawn from a
factory, crash reified as a message, restart under a monotonic intensity
window, escalation when restarting stops making sense.

## The facade seam

C# never sees a discriminated union, an `AsyncReplyChannel`, or an F#
function type. `Counter` exposes plain methods returning `Task`s; the rich
protocol lives inside the F# assembly. Every consumer keeps this boundary:
rich types inside, boring .NET surface at the edge.

## The ActorRef swap

Restart creates a *new* `MailboxProcessor` — any caller holding the old one
would post into a dead mailbox forever. `ActorRef` is the stable indirection:
the supervisor calls `Swap` on every (re)start, so the same C# reference
transparently routes to the live instance. Pinned by
`SameCounterReference_StillWorksAfterRestart`.

## Crash as a message

A `MailboxProcessor` whose body throws dies *silently* — the exception
surfaces only on its `.Error` event. The supervisor subscribes at spawn and
converts the event into a `ChildExit` message posted to its **own** mailbox
(the Node/BEAM idiom: failure is ordinary data). Because the supervisor is
itself an actor, crashes are handled strictly one at a time — no concurrent
restart races by construction.

## Restart intensity on a monotonic clock

The sliding window (`maxRestarts` within `window`) distinguishes a transient
blip (restart, quietly heal) from a persistent fault (escalate: log
`actor.escalate`, fire `OnEscalated`, stop restarting — the child stays dead
and asks against it fault with `TimeoutException` instead of hanging).

Window math runs on an **injectable monotonic clock** (`Environment.TickCount64`
default), never `DateTime.UtcNow`: wall time steps under NTP corrections and
dual-boot RTC skew, which would silently stretch or shrink the window. Tests
inject a `FakeClock` and advance it explicitly — "6 seconds pass" is one line,
not a real sleep. Pinned by `SlidingWindow_PrunesAgedAttempts_NoFalseEscalation`.

## The generic Worker — the convergence seam

`Worker<'Req,'Reply>` (`Worker.fs`) is how the C# dispatcher rides this
machinery without the F# assembly ever seeing a domain type — the dependency
arrow points C# host → F# lib, so `HookEvent`/`Effect` can never appear here.
It wraps a caller-supplied `Func<'Req, Task<'Reply>>` in a supervised
`MailboxProcessor`: `Supervised(sup, id, handlerFactory)` treats the factory
as the child spec (a fresh delegate per restart = fresh handler state), and
`AskAsync` rethrows a handler exception with its original stack
(`ExceptionDispatchInfo`), so to the asker it looks exactly like awaiting the
delegate directly. A failure inside the worker is **reply-then-crash**: reply
`Choice2Of2 ex` first (the asker learns immediately instead of burning its ask
timeout), then raise (so `.Error` still fires and the supervisor restarts or
escalates). The dispatcher spawns one worker per handler registration — see
[hook-dispatch.md](hook-dispatch.md) and
[ADR-0002](../adr/0002-handlers-as-supervised-actors.md).

## The two mailbox flavors

| | `MailboxProcessor` (default) | `Channel` (hot path) |
|---|---|---|
| mailbox | **unbounded** — `Post` never waits | **bounded** — `WriteAsync` awaits a slot |
| backpressure | none (watch `CurrentQueueLength`) | `FullMode.Wait` throttles the producer |
| ask | native `AsyncReplyChannel` | hand-rolled (`TaskCompletionSource`) |
| speed | ~10× more per-message allocation | purpose-tuned, low-allocation |
| use for | the 95% — supervised, stateful workers | bursty/high-volume sinks |

`AuditWriter` is the Channels shape in F# (via the `task { }` CE):

```
 producer ──WriteAsync──► [■■■■■■■■] capacity N ──TryRead──► slow consumer
               │ full? the WRITE awaits a slot (no thread blocked)
               ▼
    producer throttled to consumer pace — memory bounded by construction
```
